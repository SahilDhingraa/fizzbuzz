# fizzbuzz 

Hii So this program works as follows:<br/>
1) You have to enter a number.<br/>
2) If the number is divisible by 5 it prints "Fizz".<br/>
3) If the number is divisible by 3 it prints "Buzz".<br/>
4) And if the number divisible by both 5&3 it prints "Fizz Buzz!".<br/>
5) If you want to leave the program enter any -ve number.
